# Welcome to Badger

**Badger** is the easiest way to add achievements and gamification to your app. Built for developers, it provides a lightweight API that lets you create badges, track user progress, and reward your users with minimal setup.

## What is Badger?

Badger is a developer-first gamification platform that helps you:

- **Create engaging badges** with flexible conditions and rewards

Whether you're building a productivity app, a learning platform, or a social network, Badger helps you keep users engaged and motivated through gamification.

## Key Features

Create badges with various conditions:

- **Event-based**: Award badges when users perform specific actions
- **Count-based**: Track cumulative achievements (e.g., "Complete 10 tasks")
- **Streak-based**: Reward consistent behavior (e.g., "7-day login streak")
- **Sum/Average**: Track metrics over time
- **Badge dependencies**: Create badge trees and progression systems

### 📊 **Smart Progress Tracking**

- Webhook integrations

### ⚡ **Developer-Friendly**

## How It Works

### 1. **Create Your App**

Sign up and create your first app in the [Badger dashboard](https://app.usebadger.dev). You'll get an `appId` and `appSecret` for API access.

### 2. **Create Badges**

Use the dashboard to create badges with custom conditions, images, and rewards. Define what users need to do to unlock each badge.

### 3. **Track Events**

Send events from your app when users perform actions:

```typescript
await badger.events.sendEvent({
  userId: "user123",
  event: "task_completed",
  metadata: { taskType: "coding", difficulty: "hard" },
});
```

### 4. **Award Badges**

Badges are automatically awarded when conditions are met.

### 5. **Engage Users**

Display badges, progress, and rewards in your app to keep users motivated and engaged.

npm install @usebadger/sdk

  userId: "user123",
